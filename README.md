# Lab | Reading About Statistic Concepts

In the future, you will need to understand deep statistical concepts by reading technical articles. As a training for that, it is interesting to start from here. Also, as we have limited time, this is a way to have some self guided learning to understand everything better and have a wider knowledge.

This week you will find some questions here that you will need to answer by documentating yourself. So you will do a different PR for each question (you are meant to answer the questions in different days). Don't hesitate to write as many text as you need and push images if you need them.

Remember for this lab: there is a right answer. But there is no perfect way to explain it (except for in a mathematical way, but this is another story).

## Challenge 1: What is the difference between expected value and mean?

A practical approach results in a frequency distribution and a mean value; a theoretical approach results in a probability distribution and an expected value.
